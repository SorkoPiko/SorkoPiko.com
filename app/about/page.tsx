				<p className="mt-4 about pb-16">I first started coding in late 2015. Python had peaked my interest, and I started following tutorials. Soon, I was making simple apps for all sorts of things, ranging from small games to mathematical calculators. I kept making small things until I found Github in 2018. As soon as I saw what github had to offer, I started working on my own site. This was my first project in HTML and CSS. However, I lacked the skill at the time to use Javascript.
				<br /><br />
				Soon after, I followed a course which taught me the fundamentals of websites. I soon added some simple Javascript to my site, which finished my site. After this, it only received minor updates every now and then. Later, in 2020, I wanted to try making a Discord bot. Because I already knew Python, I decided to make it in Python. This bot progressed me far further than any other prior Python project. For the next few years, I would create private Discord bots for my servers.
				<br /><br />
				Later, in 2023, I started working on Blooket-related projects, contributing to the repo Blooket-Cheats, creating a Discord bot for it, and creating a Blooket client with the creator of the Blooket-Cheats repo. However, all of these projects were shut down by a cease and desist from the creator of Blooket. Later that year, I created a helper bot for the popular Discord bot Ballsdex. However, I soon lost interest and abandoned the project.
				<br /><br />
				In early January 2024, I started playing Hypixel Bedwars, and created a Discord bot that could link your Discord server to your Hypixel guild. Soon after, decided to learn Skript, a Java alternative for Minecraft servers, used to make custom plugins. I started taking paid requests for custom plugins, and soon after, I started working on my own server, Oasis Events, which is still in development.
				<br /><br />
				In March, I decided to finally update my website, which was severely outdated. However, instead of using HTML, CSS and JS, like I did for my original one, I decided to create it in NextJS. This allowed me to customize it beyond anything I could have imagined.
