				<p className="mt-4 about pb-16">I first started coding in late 2015. Python had interested me, and I started following tutorials. Soon, I was making simple apps for all sorts of things, ranging from small games to mathematical calculators. In 2018, I started working on my own site. This was my first project in HTML and CSS. However, I lacked the skill at the time to use Javascript.
				<br /><br />
				Soon after, I followed a course which taught me the fundamentals of websites. I soon added some simple Javascript to my site, which I then considered complete. After this, it only received minor updates every now and then. Later, in 2020, I wanted to try making a Discord bot. I made it in python as that was my main language at the time. This bot progressed me far further than any other prior Python project. For the next few years, I would create private Discord bots for my servers.
				<br /><br />
				In early January 2024, I started playing Hypixel Bedwars, and created a Discord bot that could link your Discord server to your Hypixel guild.
				<br /><br />
				In March, I decided to finally update my website, which was quite outdated. However, instead of using HTML, CSS and JS, like I did for my original one, I decided to create it in NextJS. This allowed me to make it exactly how I imagined, and it turned out great.
				<br /><br />
				In July, I began making mods for a game which I had played for a long time, Geometry Dash. I started with simple mods, but soon moved on to more complex ones, before eventually taking commissions on Fiverr. Through making these mods, I learned C++, which I now regularly use for smaller projects. Currently (09/05/2025), my mods have 107,000 combined downloads. You can find my mods <a href="https://geode-sdk.org/mods?developer=sorkopiko" target="_blank" className="text-blue-500 underline">here</a>.
				<br /><br />
				In January of 2025, I started work on a new project, SendDB. This is a Discord bot that tracks level sends in Geometry Dash. In March, the bot was verified, and in April, it hit 100 servers. You can find the bot <a href="https://discord.gg/MeWY462WJv" target="_blank" className="text-blue-500 underline">here</a>.
