				<p className="mt-4 about">I first started coding in late 2015. Python had peaked my interest, and I started following tutorials. Soon, I was making simple apps for all sorts of things, ranging from small games to mathematical calculators. I kept making small things until I found Github in 2018. As soon as I saw what github had to offer, I started working on my own site. This was my first project in HTML and CSS. However, I lacked the skill at the time to use Javascript.
				<br /><br />
				Soon after, I followed a course which taught me the fundamentals of websites. I soon added some simple Javascript to my site, which finished my site. After this, it only received minor updates every now and then. Later, in 2020, I wanted to try making a Discord bot. Because I already knew Python, I decided to make it in Python. This bot progressed me far further than any other prior Python project. For the next few years, I would create private Discord bots for my servers.
				<br /><br />
				Later, in 2023, I started working on Blooket-related projects, contributing to the repo Blooket-Cheats, creating a Discord bot for it, and creating a Blooket client with the creator of the Blooket-Cheats repo. However, all of these projects were shut down by a cease and desist from the creator of Blooket. Later that year, I created a helper bot for the popular Discord bot Ballsdex. However, I soon lost interest and abandoned the project.</p>
